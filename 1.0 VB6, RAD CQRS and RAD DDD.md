- We will implement CQRS in vb6. 
- But it is not just about vb6. It is about RAD: vb6 is an example of RAD CQRS -- after vb6, we will apply the same approach on c# or java or javascript.
    * The essence of RAD is "data-driven". 
    * DDD needs to be re-interpreted in Data-Driven perspective (so, it should be "DDDDD"). 
    * CQRS, by its very nature, is DDD in data-driven perspective.
        - Although event-queue (eventually consistency) is needed only < 5%, it is is the corner stone of CQRS. And the very nature of the concept is data-driven.
            * CQRS, by its very nature, is "Distributed DDD", hence "DDDD".    
        - The "aggregate root" can and should be understood as a (much easier) database design concept "top parent table".
