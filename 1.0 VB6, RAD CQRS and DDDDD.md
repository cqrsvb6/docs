- We will implement CQRS in vb6. 
- But it is not just about vb6. It is about RAD: "CQRS in vb6" is an example of RAD CQRS -- after vb6, we will apply the same approach on c# or java or javascript.

    * The essence of RAD is "data-driven". 
    * DDD needs to be re-interpreted in Data-Driven perspective; so, it needs to become "DDDDD". 
    * CQRS, by its very nature, is DDDDD
        - Although event-queue (eventually consistency) is needed only < 5%, it is is the cornerstone of CQRS. And, obviously, the very nature of the concept "event-queue" is data-driven.
            * Another path to reach DDDDD is via "Distributed DDD"    
        - The "aggregate root" can and should be understood as a (much easier) database design concept "top parent table".
