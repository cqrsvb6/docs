- We will implement CQRS in vb6. 
- But it is not just about vb6. It is about RAD: "CQRS in vb6" is an example of RAD CQRS -- after vb6, we will apply the same approach on c# or java or javascript.

    * The essence of RAD is "data-driven". 
    * To be really understood and useful, DDD needs to be re-interpreted in Data-Driven perspective; so, it needs to become "DDDDD". 
    * CQRS, by its very nature, is DDDDD
        - Although event-queue (eventually consistency) is needed only < 5%, it is is the cornerstone of CQRS. And, obviously, the very nature of the concept "event-queue" is data-driven.
            * Another path to reach DDDDD is via "Distributed DDD"    
        - The "aggregate root" can and should be understood as a (much easier) database design concept "top parent table". 
        
    * So, until CQRS, DDD is not understandable -- not really anyway! 
        - The basic assumption of traditional DDD that users do not care about data, they only care about behaviors is completely wrong; related to that, the image of "backend" data is complete wrong. Unless we are talking about robots, all IT is about "I" -- information, which eventually is data, not "behaviors". Data is all we are dealing with. It is necessary to get into low-level programming world, but in the big schema of things, data is the king -- users do not care whatever you say ("behaviors" or "objects"), they care only what you do -- with their data.
