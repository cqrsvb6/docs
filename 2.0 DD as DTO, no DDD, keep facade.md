- "DDs" as "DTOs": In vb6 implementation, DTOs are not classes, not even custom types. Instead, we use dictionaries ("Ds"), or, dictionaries of dictionaries ("DDs").       

    * All keys and values in the dictionary are strings.     
    * We use JSON; but again, all values in JSON are always strings.        
    * DDs are similar to "record-sets".
    * Note that in RAD perspective, the so-called "task-based UIs" just means more DDs. A lot of times, a single busy UI is better than many multi-step simple UIs, as long as the flow of the fields and buttons within the busy UI is intuitive. Very often more effort to make the application more "user friendly" actually makes thing worse.      
   
- "DDD": Because we do not use classes, so, no DDD anymore. However, some key ideas in DDD are still there; they are just "crystalized" as relational concepts, or, dictionary concepts. For exxample, the "aggregate root" can and should be understood as a (much easier) database design concept "top parent table".
    
    * The theoretical/philosophical reason of no "DDD": the pure OO model is useful only for tool-making, it is not useful for business domains, which are always modeled either with super-lightweight if-else-like rules, or, heavyweight saga-or-process-managers. We never need something in the middle. 
    * A deeper reason is, business domain changes often, so, we cannot "hardcode" them, as a result, we have to put them in "data". Hence, foundamentally, DDD is not useful for business logic. 
    * However, DDD can be re-introduced or re-interpreted or "crytallized" as event-queue-based (a.k.a. log-centric) computing. Although log-centric computing is needed < 5% of the time in practice, coneptually it is important.
        - Also note that "queues" and "logs" are conpatible with "dictionaries" -- to risk sounding like playing letters, we can say that "DDD" can be simplified into "DD".
    
- "Facades": Because a vb6 appliaction is typically deployed as 2-tier, so, the concept of "web service" is relaxed into "facades" (a.k.a. "transaction scripts", "process managers"), and somtimes in those facades, we can prompt a msgbox. The reasoning is: it is RAD; we can always fix those msgboxes when we really need to deploy the facade as a web service.
    * Based all above, CQRS means that all facades should be split into two groups: query facades and command facades.     
    * In other words, the split or "separation" in CQRS is only in facades, not in database.
