- "DD" as "DTO": In vb6 implementation, DTOs are not classes, not even custom types. Instead, we use dictionaries ("D"), or, dictionaries of dictionaries ("DD").       

    * All keys and values in the dictionary are strings.     
    * We use JSON; but again, all values in JSON are always strings.        
    * DDs are similar to "record-sets".
    * Note that in RAD perspective, the so-called "task-based UIs" just means more DDs. A lot of times, many multi-step simple UIs are NOT as good as a single busy UI, as long as the flow of the fields and buttons within the busy UI is intuitive.   
    
- "DDD": Because we do not use classes, so, no DDD anymore. However, some key ideas in DDD are still there; they are just "crystalized" as relational concepts, or, dictionary concepts.
    * The theoretical/philosophical reason of no "DDD": the pure OO model is useful only for tool-making, it is not useful for business domains, which are always modeled either with super-lightweight if-else-like rules, or, heavyweight saga-or-process-managers. We never need something in the middle.    
    
- "Facades": Because a vb6 appliaction is typically deployed as 2-tier, so, the concept of "web service" is relaxed into "facades" (a.k.a. "transaction scripts", "process managers"), and somtimes in those facades, we can prompt a msgbox. The reasoning is: it is RAD; we can always fix those msgboxes when we really need to deploy the facade as a web service.

    * Based all above, CQRS now means that all facades should be split into two groups: query facades and command facades.     
    * In other words, the split or "seapration" in CQRS is only in facades, not in database.
