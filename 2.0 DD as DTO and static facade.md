- "DDs" as "DTOs": In vb6 implementation, DTOs are not classes, not even custom types. Instead, we use dictionaries ("Ds"), or, dictionaries of dictionaries ("DDs").       

    * All keys and values in the dictionary are always strings.     
    * We use JSON; but again, all values in JSON are always strings.        
    * DDs are similar to "record-sets".
    * Note that in RAD perspective, the so-called "task-based UIs" just means complex DDs. A lot of times, a single busy UI is better than many multi-step simple UIs, as long as the flow of the fields and buttons within the busy UI is intuitive. Very often more effort to make the application more "user friendly" actually makes thing worse.      
   - Also note that "queues" and "logs" are conpatible with "dictionaries": "DDD" can be simplified into "DD" 
   
- No"domain model"
    * Business rules change often, we must find ways to represent them in data.
    * The best 2 ways to work with data are super-lightweight if-else-like rules, and, heavyweight saga-or-process-managers.
              
- "Static facades with msgboxes": Because a vb6 appliaction is typically deployed as 2-tier, so, the concept of "web service" is relaxed into "facades" (a.k.a. "transaction scripts", "process managers", again, note that no domain model is needed), and somtimes in those facades, we can prompt a msgbox. The reasoning is: it is RAD; we can always fix those msgboxes when we really need to deploy the facade as a web service.
    * Based all above, CQRS means that all facades should be split into two groups: query facades and command facades.     
    * In other words, the split or "separation" in CQRS is only in facades, not in database.
